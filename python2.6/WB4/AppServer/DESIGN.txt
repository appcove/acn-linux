WB4 App Server



Design facts:

- One server can serve multiple WB4 Instances.

- Each instance is keyed by (DevLevel, DevName) 
  This means that you cannot have two instances registered with the same DevLevel and DevName.

- Each project is keyed by (DevLevel, DevName, ProjectIdentifier)
  This means that you cannot have two of the same projects within the same Instance.

- Workers are BOUND to a (DevLevel, DevName, ProjectIdentifier).  For the entire lifetime of the
  worker, it will stay bound to the same.  This is to prevent excessive module loading, and 
  excessive database connections.

- Connections are UNBOUND.  They can be reused for any DevLevel, DevName, and Project.

- Sessions are started on Connections.  Sessions are kept alive for the duration of the "page"
  or client that is using the connection.  In other words, sessions will be started and ended
  frequently on the same connection.

- Sessions are BOUND to a (DevLevel, DevName, ProjectIdentifier).  On the Start Session packet,
  the client must specify which DevLevel, DevName, and Project to connect to.
